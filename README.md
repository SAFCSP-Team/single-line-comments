# Single-line Comments in C++

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to use comments in C++.

### Problem

Write a single-line comment explaining each line in the `main` method. 


### Implementation
- Write your comment in the main function.
  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout << "Hello ";
    cout << endl;
    cout << "World";
    return 0;
}
```
